# Welcome to Finnscapes Photoblog!

This is a simple photoblog made in my first year of studies (2018) in Haaga-Helia using CSS3 and HTML5. The pictures are taken by me.

### You can test the site live on Heroku here:

## Landing page:
Designing this page my idea was, that clicking the picture's story, a visitor would get a brief introduction to the story behind the pic.

## Gallery page:
Here I had this cool idea, that the background would be sort of a wooden workbench that pictures are organized upon. When you hover over the pictures you can see them getting pulled visible from underneath other pictures.
If you click the picture on top left corner you you will enter a modal, that holds a deeper story about the picture.

## Known bugs:
- On gallery page only top-left picture has a story modal.
- Front-page picture doesn't have a link to its own full story.
